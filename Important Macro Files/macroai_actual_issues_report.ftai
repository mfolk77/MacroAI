@issue
id: 1
severity: critical
category: Missing Data Models
file: MacroAI/MacroAI/SpoonacularAPI.swift
description: SpoonacularSearchResponse struct is missing, causing API decoding to fail
recommendation: Add the missing SpoonacularSearchResponse struct and related models
status: critical

@issue
id: 2
severity: critical
category: API Key Configuration
file: MacroAI/MacroAI/SecureConfig.swift
description: API keys are placeholder values, not real keys
recommendation: Replace placeholder API keys with actual keys

@issue
id: 3
severity: high
category: AI Chat Access
file: MacroAI/MacroAI/MacroAIApp.swift
description: ChatView exists but no way to access it from main app
recommendation: Add navigation to ChatView (already fixed in previous edit)
status: resolved

@issue
id: 4
severity: medium
category: Incomplete API Implementation
file: MacroAI/MacroAI/SpoonacularAPI.swift
description: getNutritionInfo method still returns mock data
recommendation: Implement real JSON parsing for nutrition info
status: open

@end

@issue
id: 5
severity: medium
category: OpenAI Integration
file: MacroAI/MacroAI/OpenAIAPI.swift
description: OpenAI API uses mock responses instead of real API calls
recommendation: Implement actual OpenAI API integration
status: open

## WHAT'S ACTUALLY WRONG

### 1. Missing Data Models
- **SpoonacularSearchResponse** struct is missing
- This causes the API decoding to fail
- The searchFood method tries to decode a struct that doesn't exist

### 2. API Key Configuration
- **SecureConfig.swift** has placeholder API keys
- "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY" and "YOUR_SPOONACULAR_API_KEY"
- These need to be replaced with actual API keys

### 3. Incomplete API Implementation
- **getNutritionInfo** method still returns mock data
- Only the searchFood method has real API integration

### 4. AI Chat Access (FIXED)
- **ChatView** was inaccessible from main app
- This has been fixed by adding navigation in HomeView

---

## IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED

1. **Add Missing Data Models**: Create SpoonacularSearchResponse struct
2. **Configure API Keys**: Replace placeholder keys with real ones
3. **Complete API Implementation**: Finish the getNutritionInfo method
4. **Implement Real OpenAI**: Replace mock responses with actual API calls
