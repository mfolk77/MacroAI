## 🚨 **Potential Risk Areas**

### **Critical (Test Immediately):**
1. **User Data Loss** - Check if any existing data was corrupted
2. **API Key Exposure** - Verify keys are still secure
3. **Camera Permissions** - Ensure camera access still works
4. **Subscription Status** - Check if premium features still work

### **High Priority:**
1. **Barcode Integration** - Test the feature that was being developed
2. **Food Recognition** - Verify AI photo analysis still works
3. **Recipe System** - Check Spoonacular integration
4. **Marketplace** - Verify diet/theme packs load correctly

### **Medium Priority:**
1. **UI Consistency** - Check for visual regressions
2. **Performance** - Ensure app still runs smoothly
3. **Error Handling** - Test error states
4. **Offline Functionality** - Test cached data
